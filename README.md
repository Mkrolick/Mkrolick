**cyber warfare · gene editing · pricing models · psychopolitics · ml theory** - and whatever else keeps me up at 3am.

### the fine print

i survived **trigeminal neuralgia** for two years — nicknamed *the suicide disease*. it's one of the most painful condition known to medicine (worse than childbirth). i'm still here, and i'm not slowing down.

*if it touches code, biology, markets, or minds — i'm probably interested.*
